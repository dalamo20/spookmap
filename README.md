This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

- Google OAuth Authentication: The user can sign in via Google using NextAuth's signIn() function with Google as the authentication provider configured in authOptions.ts.
- Session Management: The useSession() hook from NextAuth checks if a user is logged in and provides session data (e.g., name, image) to the Dashboard component.
- Conditional UI Rendering: If a user is authenticated, their details and a "Sign Out" button are displayed; otherwise, a "Sign in with Google" button is shown.
